    "Write a function called `max_profit` which takes in this list of stock prices, and computes the max profit possible. Return 0 if you can't make any profit.\n",

    "\n",

    "Once you have implemented your solution, run the code block containing your `max_profit` function. Be sure that your function [returns](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-return-statement/) an integer, and doesn't simply print."
